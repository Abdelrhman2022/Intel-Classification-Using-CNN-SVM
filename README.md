# Intel Classification Using CNN + SVM
In this Repo I'll use convolutional networks to perform single-label multi-class classification. The dataset contains train, test and prediction images for 6 classes.  


# Context

This is image data of Natural Scenes around the world.

# Content

This Data contains around 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories.
{'buildings' -> 0,
'forest' -> 1,
'glacier' -> 2,
'mountain' -> 3,
'sea' -> 4,
'street' -> 5 }
